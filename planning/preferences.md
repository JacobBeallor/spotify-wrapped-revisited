# PM Preferences
- Bias toward small, finishable issues over large ones
- Prefer parallel work when dependencies allow, but keep WIP low
- Default to one active "In progress" item unless explicitly allowed
- Break down L/XL issues before starting implementation
- Prefer incremental shipping over broad refactors
- Refactor only if it unblocks P0/P1 or meaningfully reduces repeated cost
- Update docs alongside code changes when reasonable
